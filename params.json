{"name":"Pucd2035d","tagline":"","body":"## Communication Design: Creative Computing\r\nParsons The New School for Design\r\n\r\nFall 2014  \r\nPUCD 2035 D  \r\nFriday, 9:00am - 11:40am  \r\nArnold Hall, 55 W 13th St., Room 402\r\n\r\nJonathan Dahan | dehanj@newschool.edu\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis course will introduce students to the building blocks of creative computing within the visual and media environment. Students will learn to create dynamic images, type and interfaces, that can translate into print, web and spatial forms. Through weekly problems, students will learn programming fundamentals that translate in virtually all programming platforms.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this class students should feel excitement (as opposed to dread) when encountering new programming languags, techniques, and technologies. They will know how to quickly find and participate in each community to help them learn. Students will have to learn how to feel comfortable working with the unfamiliar. In doing so, encounters with new technology can be seen as an opportunity to expand the breadth and depth of their craft, and as inspiration for new work.\r\n\r\n### Learning Outcomes\r\n\r\n* Demonstrate knowledge of fundamental programming concepts\r\n* Develop several visual & interactive projects\r\n* Objectively present their design process and workflow\r\n* Integrate a variety of media elements into their projects\r\n* Problem solve with other students through reading other students’ code\r\n* Demonstrate the ability to research and learn unfamiliar technical topics\r\n\r\n### Required Materials, Software, etc.\r\n\r\n+ A functioning and fully charged **laptop running OSX or linux**. Please bring this laptop to every class session.\r\n+ Student space on the School’s webserver.\r\n+ A text editor that supports syntax highlighting, such as [atom](atom.io) or [sublime text](sublimetext.com).\r\n+ A modern web browser, such as [Mozilla Firefox](firefox.org) or [Google Chrome](google.com/chrome).\r\n+ Readings and viewings will be made available online.\r\n\r\n### Attendance\r\n\r\nPer New School policy, 3 or more absences or excessive tardiness will result in a failing grade. If you need to miss class, please email me in advance.\r\n\r\n### Projects and Excercises\r\n\r\nEach week there will be a small exercises to help reinforce the ideas introduced in class. In addition, there will be three more open ended assignments, that will take more time to complete. There will be one final personal project, that can be started anytime during the course. Grades are broken down as follows\r\n\r\n**20%** attendance and participation,\r\n**30%** exercises,\r\n**30%** assignments,\r\n**20%** final project\r\n\r\n### Topics\r\n\r\nWe will cover at least the following topics in depth:\r\n\r\n- Networks\r\n- Numbers\r\n- The Terminal\r\n- Hardware\r\n- Interfaces\r\n- APIs\r\n- Operating Systems\r\n\r\nAn sample of interesting projects and artwork to act as inspiration for the assignments.\r\nThe exercises will help ensure working knowledge to incorporate these elements in future work.\r\n\r\nDepending on the character and interests of the class, we can cover additional topics such as security, embedded systems, functional programming, node-based programming, wireless communication, bitcoin and the blockchain, bittorrent.\r\n\r\n### Exercises\r\n\r\nPossible exercises\r\n\r\n- Watch [Robert Hodgins' Keynote]()\r\n- Contribute to a github repository\r\n  - contribute to a project with at least 15 stars on github?\r\n- Add an element of interactivity to an existing website\r\n- make bash script with at least 3\r\n- programming metaphors\r\n- use ifttt to make a new application\r\n- Read the first 3 chapets of [Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319)\r\n\r\n### Course Outline\r\n\r\nBelow is a rough outline of the semester, subject to change. It will be updated throughout the semester. Feedback\r\n\r\n#### Class `0x00`\r\n\r\n**Assignment** Create a program designed to be executed by a human  \r\n**Motivation** Language design, machine empathy, common elements  \r\n**Inspiration** Sol LeWitt  \r\n**Excercise** Sign up for github, file an issue for the class\r\n\r\nFor the first assignment we will have to write a program designed to be executed by a human. You can write this in any language, but the final output must be created only by handing a person a sheet of paper. We will review our experiences after 30 minutes, discussing what programming concepts we have discovered. The final version of this assignment will be due in 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nSyllabus Overview (30 minutes)\r\nProgram a friend explanation (15 minutes)\r\nProgramming (45 minutes)\r\n - My [sample program](0x01_human_program.md)\r\n - Cool [student](http://instagram.com/p/sSU-5zRxA0/) [programs](http://instagram.com/p/sSVD-uRxA7/)\r\nDiscussion of basic concepts (30 minutes)\r\n - We identified variables, and loops.\r\n - We talked about compilers, and operating systems.\r\nWhat are your questions about technology? (30 minutes)\r\n - Here is [the list of questions we came up with](questions.md)\r\n\r\n#### Class `0x01`\r\n\r\nLanguages and language design. Introduce javascript.\r\n\r\n**Exercise** come up with a metaphor for a programming concept / program in a language you have never programmed before  \r\n**Inspiration** Show the same program in python, bash, piet, clojure, javascript, maybe with wikicode  \r\n**Motivation** get familiar with all the ways to express a concept  \r\n\r\n#### Class `0x02`\r\n\r\n**motivation** introduction to how operating systems work  \r\n**inspiration** kyle macdonald, r/glitchart  \r\n\r\nWhat is a file?
